This repository contains a Jupyter notebook with code to the Kaggle Titanic challenge. The aim is to predict which pessengers would have survived the titanic sinking.

The focus of this challenge will be, in contrast to the House Price Prediction challenge in my Github Account, more on exploratory data analysis and feature engineering.
